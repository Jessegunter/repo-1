# Zero Eyes

## Origin and Over view

* Zero Eyes was started in 2018 by a group of Navy SEALs. Mike Lahiff, Rob Huberty, Sam Alaimo, & Dustin Brooks.

* The idea came about after the Stoneman douglas school shooting. This group of veterans wanted to come up with a solution that would help prevent as many deaths in these situations.

* The company raised $31 million dollars over multiple rounds of funding.

## Business Activities

* The problem Zero Eyes is trying to solve is not being reactive to active shooter situations but being proactive and allowing authorties the time to try and get to the scene faster.

* This company has software that is set up to alert the police as soon as there is a gun detection.

* Zero Eyes intended customer is Schools and Hospitals. 

* What this company does that thier competitors dont is have the ability to alert authorties as soon as a gun is detected.

## Landscape

* Zero Eyes is in the security and surveillance industry.

* The innovations this feild has seen in the last 10 years has a lot to do with technology and AI, the main innovations are facial recognition, ML for threat detection, and cloud based surveillance which revolutionized how video is stored.

* The other companies in this field are, Evolve tech, Xtract one, & Omnilert.

## Results

* This business has been able to provide security to school to protect childern by increasing response times to active shooters and also by deturing potential shooters from attempting an attack.

* The metrics they are using is an increased response time.

* Zero Eyes is at the top of the industry compared to its competition.

## Recommendations

* If i were advising for this company i would suggest that they focus on camera placement to try and catch the gunman pulling his gun out of his vehicle. So this would mean having more cameras in the parking lot of the school not just inside or on the building.

* I think this could just be something that would increase response time even more.

* This wouldnt require any different tech it would just require instalation of cameras in places that the schools might currently not have.
